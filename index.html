      This app implements Conway's Game of Life as a full-screen "native" iOS
      app using JavaScript and the HTML5 Canvas element from within
      Objective-C. This app is primarily an academic experiment in using a
      web-based environment as a virtual machine, and as such, this app is not
      intended to change your life or make you a better person.
    </div>
    <div>
      The source code for this project will be available on GitHub as soon as
      it has been accepted into the App Store. Future updates will demonstrate
      the use of advanced hardware features from within customized JavaScript
      environments :-)
