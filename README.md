LifeGrid
========

This app implements Conway's Game of Life as a full-screen "native" iOS app
using JavaScript and the HTML5 Canvas element from within Objective-C. This
app is primarily an academic experiment in using a web-based environment as a
virtual machine, and as such, this app is not intended to change your life or
make you a better person. 

The source code for this project will be available on GitHub as soon as it has
been accepted into the App Store. Future updates will demonstrate the use of
advanced hardware features from within customized JavaScript environments :-)
